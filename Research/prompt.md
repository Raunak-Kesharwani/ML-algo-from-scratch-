# Algorithm Mastery Prompt

## step : 0 - Declare the algorithm

Algorithm Name: <WRITE ALGORITHM NAME HERE>  
Start the 12-step algorithm-mastery sequence.  
Only acknowledge that you understood and wait for Step 1.  
Do not explain anything yet.

### Example:

## STEP 1 — Problem Definition

Step 1: Give me the complete Problem Definition of the above algorithm using only mathematical symbols and formal statements. No intuition, no examples, no narrative.

## STEP 2 — Variables and Parameters

Step 2: Define all variables, parameters, assumptions, and mathematical objects used in the algorithm with precise symbolic definitions.

## STEP 3 — Model / Hypothesis Equation

Step 3: Write the exact model/hypothesis equation for the algorithm with no explanation—only equations and mathematical statements.

---

## STEP 4 — Objective / Loss Function

Step 4: Write the complete objective function/loss function, including likelihood form if applicable. No text—only formal math.

---

## STEP 5 — Full Derivation

Step 5:  
Give me a complete mathematical derivation of the algorithm  
Follow this exact structure strictly and provide *only mathematical and technical content* (no intuition, no examples, no story narration, no analogies).

### Structure:

1. **Problem Definition**
   * State the inputs, outputs, assumptions, and objective function clearly using symbols only.

2. **Mathematical Setup**
   * Define all variables, parameters, and functions used.
   * Convert the algorithm into equations and formal expressions.

3. **Derivation of the Core Equations**
   * Derive the hypothesis/model equation.
   * Derive the cost/loss function (if applicable).
   * Show all partial derivatives w.r.t parameters step-by-step.

4. **Solving for Optimal Parameters**
   * Solve the system of equations created by setting derivatives to zero.
   * Derive closed-form solutions (if they exist).
   * Otherwise, derive the update rules (e.g., gradient descent, SGD, EM, dynamic programming).

5. **Final Formula Summary**
   * Present the final compact mathematical expressions.
   * Show vector/matrix form if appropriate.

6. **Computational Form**
   * Provide final implementable formulas (gradient update or closed form).

Use mathematician-level notation and keep every step explicit.  
No intuition, no diagrams, no storytelling — only pure derivation.

## STEP 6 — Solve for Optimal Parameters

Step 6: Solve the system of equations obtained from Step 5. If closed-form exists, derive it. If not, derive update rules mathematically.

## STEP 8 — Computational Complexity

Step 8: Provide full computational and memory complexity analysis using Big-O notation. Mathematical justification only.

## STEP 9 — Pseudocode

Step 9: Provide clean algorithm pseudocode using ML-standard notation. No explanations. Only algorithm steps.

## STEP 10 — From-Scratch Implementation (Python/Numpy)

Step 10: Provide a full from-scratch implementation using only Python and NumPy. No comments, no text. Code only.
