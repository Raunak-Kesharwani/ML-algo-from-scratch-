# Mathematical Derivation Prompt

Give me a complete mathematical derivation of the algorithm **{ALGORITHM_NAME}**.  
Follow this exact structure strictly and provide *only mathematical and technical content* (no intuition, no examples, no story narration, no analogies).

## Structure:

1. **Problem Definition**
   * State the inputs, outputs, assumptions, and objective function clearly using symbols only.

2. **Mathematical Setup**
   * Define all variables, parameters, and functions used.
   * Convert the algorithm into equations and formal expressions.

3. **Derivation of the Core Equations**
   * Derive the hypothesis/model equation.
   * Derive the cost/loss function (if applicable).
   * Show all partial derivatives w.r.t parameters step-by-step.

4. **Solving for Optimal Parameters**
   * Solve the system of equations created by setting derivatives to zero.
   * Derive closed-form solutions (if they exist).
   * Otherwise, derive the update rules (e.g., gradient descent, SGD, EM, dynamic programming).

5. **Final Formula Summary**
   * Present the final compact mathematical expressions.
   * Show vector/matrix form if appropriate.

6. **Computational Form**
   * Provide final implementable formulas (gradient update or closed form).

Use mathematician-level notation and keep every step explicit.  
No intuition, no diagrams, no storytelling — only pure derivation.
